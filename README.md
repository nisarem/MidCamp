# Velib Service Quality Analysis
## Description
The Velib Service Quality Analysis project aims to investigate the service quality of Velib Rental Bikes in Paris. With the growing importance of sustainable transportation, Velib bikes provide a convenient and eco-friendly option for residents and visitors in Paris. However, concerns have been raised regarding the availability of bikes and docking stations, particularly in crowded areas, which can hinder the reliability and efficiency of the service. This project seeks to address these concerns by analyzing the factors influencing bike availability and assessing the overall service quality of Velib rental bikes.

## Problem Statement
The primary questions this project seeks to answer are:

Is the Velib service efficient enough to satisfy the demand for bike rentals?
What factors influence the availability of Velib bikes at rental stations in Paris?

## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between the given factors (such as time of day, neighborhood, station capacity etc.) and the availability of Velib bikes at rental stations in Paris.

## Project Execution Timeline

- Exploration of Available Data: The project will start with exploring real-time rental data and information regarding Velib stations. This step is crucial for understanding the data landscape and identifying relevant variables.

- Data Cleaning and Variable Identification: Following data exploration, the focus will shift towards cleaning the collected data and identifying the key variables that influence bike availability. This step ensures that the data is prepared for analysis and modeling.

- Grouping and Analysis: Once the data is cleaned, it will be grouped by different variables to investigate potential causality or correlation between metrics. This analysis will provide insights into factors affecting bike availability.

- Tableau Visualization: Utilizing Tableau, visualizations will be created to illustrate the patterns and trends discovered in the data analysis phase. Visual representations will enhance understanding and facilitate insights into Velib service quality.

- Machine Learning Model Development: A machine learning model will be developed to predict the duration of unavailability for Velib rental bikes at specific stations. This predictive model will utilize historical data and various features to forecast the duration of unavailability, enabling proactive measures to improve service quality.

- Hypothesis Testing: The null hypothesis will be tested using statistical analysis techniques to determine the extent to which the given factors impact bike availability and the overall service quality of Velib rental bikes.
